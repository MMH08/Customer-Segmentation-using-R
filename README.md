# Customer-Segmentation-using-R
organization wants to know which companies are similar to each other to help in identifying potential customers of a SAAS software solution (e.g. Salesforce CRM or equivalent) in various segments of the market. The Sales Department is very interested in this analysis, which will help them more easily penetrate various market segments

We will be analyzed the stock prices using using R in the unsupervised learning tools including 'K-Means' and 'UMAP'. We will be used a combination of `kmeans()` to find groups and `umap()` to visualize similarity of daily stock returns.

# Objectives

Apply K-Means and UMAP along with `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `purrr` to create a visualization that identifies subgroups in the S&P 500 Index. We will specifically apply:

- Modeling: `kmeans()` and `umap()`
- Iteration: `purrr`
- Data Manipulation: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `tibble`
- Visualization: `ggplot2` (bonus `plotly`)

# Libraries
- library(tidyverse)
- library(tidyquant)
- library(broom)
- library(umap)
- library(plotly)
